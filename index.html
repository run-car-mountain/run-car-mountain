                            <p>
                                <!--Current position-->
                                I am a <b>PhD student</b> at the Chair of Electronic Finance and Digital Markets.
                                Here I am focusing on topics related to <b>computerized decision support</b> for <b>credit risk management</b> 
                                and how different kinds of heterogeneous data
                                (primarily textual) can be utilized, using various types of processing and
                                algorithmic approaches.</br>
                                Naturally, the challenges I face are for example, how to <b>process and transform unstructured data</b> to a more manageable
                                structure. To this end I use Python and various libraries like Pandas extensively. However, it is also of highest
                                interest whether the information contained in the textual data is actually useful or relevant when reasoning about
                                credit risk. To bridge this gap I use machine learning and statistics, in combination with visualizations.</br>
 
                                <!--Teaching-->
                                At the Master's level I taught the course Business Intelligence and Decision Support Systems
                                two semesters and the course Digital Finance one semester. In all cases I supervised the exercise which
                                consisted of interactive lectures and exercises at PC workplaces. Here the students could get to know
                                tools like Rapidminer and Tableau.</br></br>

                                <!--Previous Academic and Practical Experience-->
                                I obtained both my Bachelor's and <b>Master's degree in Business Information
                                Systems</b> from the University of Göttingen. During the Master's studies I interned at Volkswagen AG After Sales in
                                Kassel where I also wrote my Master's thesis. The goal was to examine if and how a data-driven support of spare parts 
                                refurbishment could be performed. I consulted with various stakeholders, analyzed the existant processes and
                                derived a possible way forward. This was done in close cooperation with the Volkswagen Data:Lab in Munich.</br>

                                Prior to that I did an internship at Sycor Gmbh in the SAP Business Analytics division. Here, the goal
                                was to design a Dashboard for a client using the SAP HANA Software Suite and tools like 
                                HANA Studio and SAP BO Design Studio. I was also able to get a first insight into working with geodata when
                                building a prototypical visualization application using D3.js when I was there.
